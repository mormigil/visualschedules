			Currently a Senior at Tufts University in Boston, Becket is the <span class = "dramaticize">dreamer</span> behind TeemPlay. Becket
			<br>excels at seeing the bigger picture and he uses that vision to bring the whole team to a higher level! 
			<br>With Becket leading, the team really is much greater than the sum of its parts. With unyielding optimism
			<br>and work ethic Becket gives TeemPlay the structure it will need to succeed. Becket looks forward to the
			<br>day when he can pass down the mantle, and vision, of TeemPlay to the players! He believes that,
			<br>together, we can build a game that will change the world!

		<div class = "headline_4"><h2>Willis</h2></div>
			As a Junior at UNC Chapel Hill Willis is the true <span class = "dramaticize">nerd</span> behind TeemPlay’s success to this point! Willis
			<br>has always loved video games but his passion doesn’t stop at just playing. Instead Willis spends an
			<br>enormous amount of time reading and researching everything about games from programming game
			<br>mechanics to market analytics to emerging trends in gamer psychology. Willis keeps the rest of the
			<br>team in line when they try to play fast-and-loose with facts or misquote a statistic. Willis isn’t negitive
			<br>but when he says something like “eh I guess that will work” the whole team celebrates.

		<div class = "headline_4"><h2>Steve</h2></div>
			Currently a Junior at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Steve could be characterized as the <span class = "dramaticize">“try-hard”</span>
			<br>of the team. In high school Steve was captain of the swim team and #1 at the state meet. People 
			<br>tremble in the wake of Steve’s video game avatars as his competitive nature spills into the virtual 
			<br>world! Steve brings that same fiery passion that he uses to dominate games to TeemPlay. Because of 
			<br>this passion, if Steve doesn’t know something… he goes out and teaches himself. In this way Steve
			<br>has given himself a crash course in: Unity, the CryEngine, Sony Vegas, and a long list of other odds  
			<br>and ends which made our first demo video possible.
