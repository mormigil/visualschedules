We are looking for someone young at heart and enthusiastic about what TeemPlay is doing;
someone who is willing to go the extra mile to make TeemPlay successful; someone who 
can think for themselves; someone who is not afraid to make mistakes but is quick to 
learn from them. TeemPlay is always improving because we only hire people who have the 
potential and drive to be better at something they do than anyone currently on the team.

Requirements:<br>
<ul id = "requirements_list_5">
<li>
<span class = "emphasize_5">Understand and agree with TeemPlay’s vision. </span>This doesn’t mean agree with every idea 
about how to get there... you are expected to have your own opinions <em>and to share 
them...</em> but if, at your core, you do not agree with the vision that TeemPlay is working 
towards you will be unable to care about TeemPlay as much as this job will require you 
to.
</li>
<li>
<span class = "emphasize_5">Have a high risk tolerance.</span> This is a startup. The 
reward at the end of the tunnel is great because the risk involved in getting there is 
not trivial. For this reason it is considered a plus if you are young and it is 
required that you are in a place in life where you can afford to take this risk. That 
being said, understand the risk as it applies to you. If you are a freshly graduated 
college student looking to get into the industry, joining TeemPlay may only be a minor
<img id = "frontImage" src = "t_shaped.jpg" alt = "T shaped model" align="right"></img> 
risk to you if you can learn from the experience. The saying is, “Shoot for the 
moon because if you miss you will land among the stars.”
</li>
<li>
<span class = "emphasize_5">Be flexible and resourceful. </span>In a regular job this
is a plus but in a startup environment being flexible and resourceful is a 
requirement. At TeemPlay we have adopted Valve’s emphasis on hiring “T” shaped people.
You should be able to wear many hats at TeemPlay while being especially skilled at 
doing one thing better than anyone else can.
